# ScarVi - Scare the Virus

- Many people have studied peculiar sounds created by many insects.

- In 1991, a pathobiologist had made a quantitative assessment of the germicidal efficacy of ultrasound energy.

- In 2008, two physicists used atomistic approach to compute low frequency mechanical modes of viral capsids.

- This research was perceived as a new way to kill viruses by shaking them to death.

- In 2017, several physicists used x-ray scattering method to reveal nanoscale structural features of viruses.

- Studies like this enable us to compute frequencies of resonance with the outer shells of corona viruses.

- Using this approach, we will find inaudible sound waves and soliton pulses that can scare or kill Covid-19 viruses.

- We will then make a device called ScarVi, which will consist of two active parts.

- ScarVi's artificial intelligence part will detect people with Covid-19 infection within a group of people.

- ScarVi's acoustic shower part will spread acoustic waves or solitons that can deactivate or kill Covid-19 viruses.

- ScarVi device may be installed on pillars or walls in locations where many people gather or travel.

- We believe that ScarVi will greatly reduce the spread of Covid-19.
